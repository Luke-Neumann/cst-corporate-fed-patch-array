A time-boxed CST study of a 1×4 corporate-fed patch array near 5 GHz. The design uses quarter-wave transformers to realize 1→2→4 power splits and in-phase excitation at the elements. Repository includes CST files, field/pattern exports, and notes on layout and feed routing. Intent is to document topology and behavior; full S₁₁/bandwidth optimization is left for future iterations.
