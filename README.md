# cst-corporate-fed-patch-array
1×4 microstrip patch array designed in CST with a corporate feed using quarter-wave transformers (1→2→4). Focuses on feed topology, in-phase excitation, and radiation patterns. Includes CST project files and exported plots; matching/S11 optimization left as future work.
